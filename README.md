# QSTP Introduction To MATLAB

This repository contains all reading materials from the mechatronics summer course taught by [Ashutosh Gupta](https://github.com/Ashutosh781), [Pranav Goyal](https://github.com/pranavgo) and [Sanskar Jain](https://github.com/sanskarjain7), as part of the QSTP initiative. Millions of engineers and scientists worldwide use MATLAB for a range of applications, in industry and academia, including deep learning and machine learning, signal processing and communications, image and video processing, control systems, test and measurement, computational finance, and computational biology. The goal of this project is to introduce beginners to MATLAB and its applications in robotics.

## Course Structure

The content will first cover the very basics of MATLAB and Simulink along with some of its very important toolboxes and implement a basic PID controller on it. After that, it will move to a more specific application in Robotics using Simscape Multibody, Stateflow, and Robotic System Toolbox. Then will also cover some basic concepts of Controls and Motion Planning. Finally using all this to create a simulation of the Pick and Place arm in MATLAB.

## Software Requirements

1. [MATLAB and Simulink](https://in.mathworks.com/downloads/) (Mathworks products) have free students’ licenses for a few universities. If you are unable to download large files, you may use the online version of MATLAB, and Xcos instead of Simulink.
2. If your university/college does not have a free student’s license available for Mathworks products, you can use alternative software like [Scilab and Xcos](https://www.scilab.org/download/6.0.2).
3. [Robotic System Toolbox](https://in.mathworks.com/products/robotics.html)  provides tools and algorithms for designing, simulating, and testing manipulators, mobile robots, and humanoid robots.
4. [Stateflow](https://in.mathworks.com/products/stateflow.html) is a control logic tool used to model reactive systems via state machines and flow charts within a Simulink model.

### What is QSTP?

Quark Summer Technical Projects (QSTP) is a platform where experienced BITS students (currently in their 2/3/4th year); part of the clubs or independently; mentor Project-centric Courses for other students over the summer. This course will start from 6th July 2021.

Quark Summer Technical Projects (QSTP) in association with GDG (Google Developers Group) & WTM (Women Techmakers) Goa is open for participation from all students irrespective of their branch and year of study.
